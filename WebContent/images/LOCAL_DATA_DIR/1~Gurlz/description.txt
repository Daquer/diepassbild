GURLZ - analog ladies (2012 - 2015).<br/><br/>founded from a fashion conceptual series made in 35mm, this project intend to show the influence of the visual identities of the 1960s and 1970s in fashion, escaping from the traditional movements that are stereotyped for those decades and focusing on the underground scene and in the effervescence of the streets. my biggest goal was give to girls who are not models the empowerment of being able to transmit professional content, fleeing from beauty stereotypes. <br/><br/>camera: yashica 108 multiprogram. <br/><br/>films: kodak ultramax 400, kodak colorplus 200, kodak proimage 100, kodak gold 100, fuji superia (200, 400, 800), provia 100f, sensia 100, lomography xr 50 - 200. <br/><br/>location: joinville, sc, br.
